#Habit App

Habit App is a role based habit and task manager. The design is based off of the book Atmoic Habits which proposes that outcomes are best reached not through striving towards goals but instead setting acheivable daily habits. 

Identity(Role)->Process(Habits)->Outcomes(Goals)

If you set your habits around an identity you desire as those habits become a part of your everyday life you will slowly start to view youself with that identity which drives the process farther acheiving great outcomes. 

An example would be someone learning the guitar might not feel like a guitarist but after practcing everyday over a period of time that identity might start to solidfy itself making the process of learning and expanding knowledge of the guitar more natural.
